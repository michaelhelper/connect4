# connect4
#Put comments here

This is our connect 4 project that we worked on for our minds and machines class. it uses basic look ahead functionality 
and minor minimaxing, along with a few other things to make it work. It is not perfect, but it is a good start.

If you would like to use it, run the server and the client in the "mindsmachines-connect4" folder.
Then when you use the program, you can either create a game and it will give you the ID or you can join a game with 
a randomly generated ID.

Special thanks to exoRift for making the client!
